This project is a comprehensive Movie Management System built using Spring Boot. It leverages CRUD operations for managing movies, members and integrates Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization. The system provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to efficiently manage library resources and for members to easily access and borrow books.
